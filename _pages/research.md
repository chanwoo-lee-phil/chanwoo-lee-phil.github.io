Many of my current research projects revolve around the intersection of general philosophy of science, metaphysics, and philosophy of mathematics. I believe that the synergy between these areas can lead to more exciting inquiries. 

## Dissertation Project

The working title of my dissertation is "Category-theoretic Structuralism as a Foundation of Mathematics." My project investigates the foundational roles of a category-theoretic (CT) framework. I ask how CT can be autonomous and consider its appeal as a foundational framework. I approach this question from more general and diverse perspectives, considering their implications on CT.

In Chapter 1, I review structuralism in philosophy of mathematics and the philosophical debates around CT, explaining how these two lines of thought came together and led to the emergence of CT-structuralism.

In Chapter 2, I introduce the fine-grained notion of 'conception' to the foundation of mathematics. Using orthodox set theory as an example, I show how the same foundational account can be conceived of in multiple ways, which leads to a significant difference in foundational debates. I argue that the introduction of this fine-grained notion also allows us a response to the well-known critique of CT-structuralism known as 'the problem of the home address.'

In Chapter 3, I consider the relationship between structuralism and inferentialism, which have been seldom considered together. Based on their common historical origin in the famous Frege-Hilbert debate, I argue that structuralists can, and should, be inferentialists. I also consider how this conclusion allows us to overcome another well-known critique of CT-structuralism known as 'the mismatch objection.' 

In Chapter 4, I link the debates on CT-foundation with the growing scholarship on mathematical explanation. I argue that the term 'foundation' can be understood in an explanatory sense, which is backed up by both historical and philosophical considerations. Based on recent case studies about the explanation in Galois theory and CT, I suggest that the philosophy of mathematical practice can shed new light on more traditional, foundational debates.

In Chapter 5, I argue that the classic metaphor of CT as 'the language of mathematics' can be explicated using the notion of metaphysical perspicuity. I analyze the notion of metaphysical perspicuity, which has begun to receive philosophical interest in many subfields, and challenge some common conceptions about the notion. This will allow us to better understand the appeal of CT as the language of mathematics based on other notable cases.

## Publication
### From Indeterminacy in a Fundamental Theory to Fundamental Indeterminacy?
_Analytic Philosophy_, forthcoming

> In this paper, I examine a case for fundamental indeterminacy (FI) by Elizabeth Barnes and offer my counterarguments. Barnes’ account of FI includes both the characterization of FI and why we need to accept it. I argue that her reasons for accepting FI can be challenged even when we accept her characterization of FI. [...]

### The Structuralist Approach to Underdetermination
_Synthese_, 2022. [https://doi.org/10.1007/s11229-022-03495-3](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11229-022-03495-3)

> This paper provides an exposition of the structuralist approach to underdetermination, which aims to resolve the underdetermination of theories by identifying their common theoretical structure. [...] as a case study, I review a recent debate in metaphysics between Shamik Dasgupta, Jason Turner, and Catharine Diehl to consider the extent to which different instances of the structuralist schema are conceptually unified.
